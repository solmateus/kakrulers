# Kak Rulers


Options to highlight current line, current row, or the row of max characters per line before wrapping. A fork of @insipx's kak-crosshairs.

### Commands:
- `rulers` -> Toggle the highlighting of all of the rulers on and off.
- `ruler_line` -> Toggle the highlighting of the current line.
- `ruler_column` ->  Toggle the highlighting of the current column.
- `ruler_wrapcolumn` -> Toggle the highlighting of the wrap column. 

Special thanks for @insipx.
